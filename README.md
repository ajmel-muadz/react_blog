# react_blog

This is a blog site built using the MERN tech stack - MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS. It is still a work in progress, as the site is not perfect. I do not plan to release this for the public to use, rather it is a demo.

# How to run the program

1) In the `react_blog` (root folder), navigate to `/backend`.

2) Once in the `/backend` folder, type `npm install`. Once node modules are installed, type: `nodemon server.js` which runs the backend server.

3) While backend server runs, open another terminal in the same `react_blog` root folder. Navigate to `/frontend`.

4) While in the `/frontend` folder, type `npm install`. Once node modules are installed, type:
`npm run dev` which will run the frontend site.

# How to login

As this is a demo, I will provide a few accounts for you to use to log in. The accounts are displayed below:
